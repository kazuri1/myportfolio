          This case study will focus on my work on macOS native compatibility
          for the core autofill product!

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Users needed a way to quickly and securely fill login credentials
          without disrupting their workflow. The existing solution was
          functional but didn't feel native to macOS, creating friction in the
          user experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="solution">
        <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
        <p>
          We developed a native macOS integration that leverages system APIs for
          seamless autofill. This included deep integration with Safari, Chrome,
          and other browsers while maintaining 1Password's security standards.

      <section id="process">
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          Our design process involved extensive user research, prototyping, and
          iterative testing. We conducted user interviews with power users and
          conducted A/B testing to validate our design decisions.
        </p>

      <section id="outcome">
        <h2>Outcome & Results</h2>
        <p>
          The solution achieved a 40% improvement in user satisfaction and 25%
          faster login times. Users reported feeling more confident in the
          security of their credentials while experiencing a smoother workflow.

      <section id="learnings">
        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          We learned the importance of respecting platform conventions and user
          expectations. Native integrations require careful consideration of
          both technical constraints and user experience principles.
